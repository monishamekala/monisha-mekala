                        My love for computers started way back in 4th grade with a turtle named LOGO. I remember being totally amazed at how a few commands could make that little turtle draw shapes on the screen! From then on, I was hooked‚Äîlearning how to "speak" to computers felt like learning magic. Later, in high school, I‚Äôd watch my sister, a data engineer, work with scripts and data. She‚Äôd patiently explain how data was stored and organized, I would understand bits and parts of it but I found myself wanting to know more. That‚Äôs what set me on the path to pursue Bachelor's degree in the field of Information Science and Engineering
                        <p></p>
                        As I dug deeper, I fell in love with creating websites and designing databases, and my curiosity kept growing as new technologies came along. One of my proudest moments was working on a project to detect Alzheimer‚Äôs early using machine learning. Watching professors take an interest in our progress was thrilling! After a few internships and work experiences as a Web Developer and Software Engineer, I realized there was still so much to learn. Now, I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Computer Science, ready for whatever exciting challenges come next. Learning keeps me inspired, and every new project just makes me want to dive deeper into this ever-evolving world of tech.
