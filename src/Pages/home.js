                        My love for computers started way back in 4th grade with a turtle named LOGO. I remember being totally amazed at how a few commands could make that little turtle draw shapes on the screen! From then on, I was hooked‚Äîlearning how to "speak" to computers felt like learning magic. Later, in high school, I‚Äôd watch my sister, a data engineer, work with scripts and data. She‚Äôd patiently explain how data was stored and organized, I would understand bits and pieces of it but I found myself wanting to know more. That‚Äôs what set me on the path to pursue Bachelor's degree in the field of Information Science and Engineering
                        <p></p>
                        As I dug deeper, I fell in love with creating websites and designing databases, and my curiosity kept growing as new technologies came along. One of my proudest moments was working on a project to detect Alzheimer‚Äôs early using machine learning. Watching professors take an interest in our progress was thrilling! After a few internships and work experiences as a Web Developer and Software Engineer, I realized there was still so much to learn. Now, I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Computer Science, ready for whatever exciting challenges come next. Learning keeps me inspired, and every new project just makes me want to dive deeper into this ever-evolving world of tech.

                                            <strong>Algorithm Development:</strong> Developed the Bi-RNN algorithm, tackling challenges in dataset reading and integration. Utilized Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) techniques, achieving 92% accuracy and an AUC of 91-95%.
                                            <br></br>

                                            <strong>Research Contributions:</strong> Presented the research at the National Conference on Convergence of Science, Technology & Management, Bangalore, and published findings in reputable journals, including <em>'Early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs: Modalities and Methods'</em> in IRO Journals and <em>'Early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs using blood plasma proteins with Recurrent Neural Networks'</em> in IFREP.
                                            <br></br>

                                            <strong>Technical Contributions:</strong> Focused on algorithm development, data preprocessing, and feature engineering. Achieved 92% accuracy on a 13,500-record dataset from ADNI, resolving data imbalance and overfitting issues, which improved prediction accuracy by 20%. Managed project timelines, maintained quality documentation, conducted code reviews, and ensured timely delivery.
