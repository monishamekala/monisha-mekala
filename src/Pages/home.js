                        My love for computers started way back in 4th grade with a turtle named LOGO. I remember being totally amazed at how a few commands could make that little turtle draw shapes on the screen! From then on, I was hookedâ€”learning how to "speak" to computers felt like learning magic. Later, in high school, Iâ€™d watch my sister, a data engineer, work with scripts and data. Sheâ€™d patiently explain how data was stored and organized, I would understand bits and pieces of it but I found myself wanting to know more. Thatâ€™s what set me on the path to pursue Bachelor's degree in the field of Information Science and Engineering
                        <p></p>
                        As I dug deeper, I fell in love with creating websites and designing databases, and my curiosity kept growing as new technologies came along. One of my proudest moments was working on a project to detect Alzheimerâ€™s early using machine learning. Watching professors take an interest in our progress was thrilling! After a few internships and work experiences as a Web Developer and Software Engineer, I realized there was still so much to learn. Now, Iâ€™m pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, ready for whatever exciting challenges come next. Learning keeps me inspired, and every new project just makes me want to dive deeper into this ever-evolving world of tech.

                                            Led a team at Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management, Bangalore, in developing a machine learning solution for early Alzheimer's disease detection. The project involved creating a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) algorithm to analyze blood plasma and assess the disease's stage, aiming to provide a quick and cost-effective early diagnosis method.

                                            <strong>Technical Contributions:</strong> Focused on algorithm development, data preprocessing, and feature engineering. Achieved 92% accuracy on a 13,500-record dataset from ADNI, resolving data imbalance and overfitting issues, which improved prediction accuracy by 20%. Managed project timelines, maintained quality documentation, conducted code reviews, and ensured timely delivery.
